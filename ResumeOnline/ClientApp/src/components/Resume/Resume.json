James is very versatile in his skills and willing to help the organization move forward. At Verisign, James was one of the main developers and support team members for the wireless provisioning application. The main function of this area of the system provisioned wireless subscribers into the switch to activate or deactivate wireless telephone service in real-time. The application also managed the subscriber call detail records. James and I also worked together at Ingenious Med (IM). James was a senior member of the Reporting and Data Warehouse application when he arrived at IM. He designed and implemented the security portion of the application. He was also a member of the application architecture team and later worked as part of the Integration team. He is always willing to do what is needed to keep the application moving forward. His technical skills are a true asset as well as his knowledge and experience. As the CTO at Ingenious Med, I was happy to have James as part of the Technical team and appreciated his contributions very much.",
